# __d_lookup

```
/**
 * __d_lookup - search for a dentry (racy)
 * @parent: parent dentry
 * @name: qstr of name we wish to find
 * Returns: dentry, or NULL
 *
 * __d_lookup is like d_lookup, however it may (rarely) return a
 * false-negative result due to unrelated rename activity.
 *
 * __d_lookup is slightly faster by avoiding rename_lock read seqlock,
 * however it must be used carefully, eg. with a following d_lookup in
 * the case of failure.
 *
 * __d_lookup callers must be commented.
